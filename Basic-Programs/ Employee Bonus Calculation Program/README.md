This C program calculates the bonus for employees based on their category, basic salary, days worked, and daily payment. It supports three employee categories:

Category 1: Bonus is twice the basic salary.
Category 2: Bonus is awarded only if days worked exceed 240, calculated as 20 times the daily pay.
Category 3: Fixed bonus amount of 50,000.
The program runs in a loop, allowing the user to calculate bonuses for multiple employees until they choose to exit. It demonstrates the use of conditional statements, loops, and user input handling in C programming.
