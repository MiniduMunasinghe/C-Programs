This C program calculates and analyzes the sales performance of two salespersons over three products. It allows the user to input the sales amounts for each product sold by both salespersons and then computes the total sales for each individual. The program identifies the salesperson with the highest total sales and displays the sales data in a tabular format. This is a straightforward and efficient program, ideal for understanding multi-dimensional arrays and basic computational logic in C programming.
